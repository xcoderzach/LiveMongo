LiveMongo
=========

  LiveMongo is a client-server javascript library which implements the MongoDB
api on on the client and server.  It differs from the MongoDB api in that it
also adds EventEmitter functionality to collections and documents.  This
project is extracted out of the [LiveDocument](http://github.com/xcoderzach/LiveDocument)
project.  And is what that project will be built on top of.
